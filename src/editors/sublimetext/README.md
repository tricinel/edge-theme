## Settings

### Preferences

```
"edge_sidebar_font_small": false, // use a small font in the sidebar
"edge_sidebar_font_normal": false, // use a normal font in the sidebar
"edge_sidebar_font_large": false, // use a large font in the sidebar
"edge_sidebar_font_xlarge": false, // use an extra large font in the sidebar
"edge_use_sidebar_folder_icons": true, // use folder icons in the sidebar

### Font

`Edge` uses [__Hack__](http://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) as main font and it's highly recommended to install it to get a monospaced font in the filetree. But if you don't have it then the UI theme will downgrade to standard UI font used in Sublime Text. You can also disable it via `Edge Theme: Preferences`.

### File Icons

`Edge` is built from its initial release to support customization via [A File Icon](https://github.com/ihodev/a-file-icon) package. Please install it and restart Sublime for a better user expereince.
