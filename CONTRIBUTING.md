# What is Edge?

`Edge` is a simple theme with bright colors. Edge comes in three versions â€” *Night Sky*, *Serene* and *Ocean* for all day long comfortable work. The theme has a few customisable options to help you personalise your experience with it.

I've designed Edge with a multi-editor process in mind, so that the same theme can be reused on multiple editors, starting with Sublime Text 3 in its initial release and counting on VSCode and Atom support in later versions.

## Filing issues

Please [check the existing issues](https://github.com/tricinel/edge-theme/issues) to make sure your issue hasn't already been filed.

If you have a bug to report, please file it.

If you'd like to see a feature implemented, you can file an issue, but help is always appreciated.

If you'd like to contribute to Edge, it's as simple as opening a pull request on GitHub for this repo. After that, I will code review your work and either ask you to fix any errors or merge the code into master. Here are a few tips to ensure the process goes smoothly:

* Any change that involves colors, icons or styles needs to be tested on all supported editors.
* Do your work in a feature branch in order to keep things clean and easy
* Run `yarn build` before you commit

### Editor support

* Sublime Text 3 (since v1.0.0)

*Currently, Edge supports Sublime Text 3 (since version 1.0.0). I am looking to support VS Code and Atom in future releases.*
